                Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns are intensifying the spread of mosquito-borne diseases 
                such as malaria, dengue, and Zika. Researchers highlight how climate change is reshaping vector distribution 
                across Africa, Asia, and even parts of Europe and North America. Modern predictive tools like GIS and remote 
                sensing are now being used to anticipate outbreaks and strengthen public health responses.

            <p>
                Beyond physical health, climate change is affecting mental well-being. Extreme heat in 2024 led to a nearly 
                10% rise in psychiatric hospital admissions in the UK. Flood risks and unpredictable weather events are 
                increasing stress and anxiety among communities. Researchers emphasize the need for integrated climate and 
                mental health policies.

                Assam has completed six climate research projects, including vulnerability assessments and green budget 
                tagging. Nine more projects are underway, focusing on flood management, decarbonisation pathways, and 
                building climate-resilient towns. These initiatives highlight how local governments are taking proactive 
                steps to adapt to climate challenges.

            <p>
                The annual “10 New Insights in Climate Science” report (2025/2026) synthesizes findings from over 70 
                scientists worldwide. Key takeaways include weakening carbon sinks in forests and soils, worsening outbreaks 
                of mosquito-borne diseases, and heat stress reducing labor productivity. These insights provide critical 
                guidance for policymakers navigating this climate-critical decade.

                A landmark report published in BioScience warns that the planet’s vital signs are “flashing red.” 
                Human-driven climate alterations are no longer distant threats but present realities. The report calls for 
                urgent action to address political inaction, misinformation, and unsustainable economic systems.
