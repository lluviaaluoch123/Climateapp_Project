        <h2> National Mitigation Measures & Low-Carbon Growth</h2>
        <p>Kenya is globally recognized for its low-carbon development path, with its strategy focused on
             enhancing carbon sinks and expanding its already dominant renewable energy sector. Key pillars
              include:</p>

        <ul class="card-list">
            <li class="card">
                <h3>Renewable Energy Leadership</h3>
                <p>Over 90% of Kenya's grid electricity is already from green sources, primarily Geothermal,
                     Hydro, and Wind e.g., Lake Turkana Wind Power. The goal is to reach 100% clean energy
                      generation in the near future and utilize the vast geothermal potential (up to 10,000MW).

            <li class="card">
                <h3>15 Billion Tree Initiative</h3>
                <p>The government is driving a national campaign to grow 15 billion trees by 2032 to increase
                     the national tree cover to over 30%. This is a massive Nature-Based Solution (NBS)
                      aimed at both carbon sequestration and enhanced water security.</p>

                <h3>Green Mobility Transition</h3>
                <p>There is significant push and investment towards Electric Vehicles, especially in the 
                    two- and the Boda Boda sector, which is critical for last-mile transport. 
                    Tax incentives and local assembly plants are driving this clean transition in the transport
                     sector.</p>

        <h2> The Dual Threat: Droughts, Floods & Lake Swelling</h2>
        <p>Kenya is highly vulnerable, with its economy heavily dependent on climate-sensitive sectors like 
            agriculture. The impacts are characterized by a vicious cycle of prolonged droughts followed by
             severe, unseasonal flooding.</p>

        <ul class="card-list">
            <li class="card">
                <h3>Recurrent Drought Crises</h3>
                <p>The recent  Horn of Africa drought (2020-2023) was the worst in 40 years, severely impacting
                     over 5 million people in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) like Turkana, Garissa, 
                     and Marsabit. It decimated livestock and forced pastoralists to migrate, leading to
                      resource conflicts.</p>
                
            </li>
            <li class="card">
                <h3>Intense El Nino Flooding</h3>
                <p>Following the drought, the 2023/2024 El Niño rains caused catastrophic 
                    riverine and flash flooding, displacing hundreds of thousands, damaging critical 
                    infrastructure, and destroying farmlands in counties like Tana River, Mandera, and Nairobi.</p>
                
            </li>
            <li class="card">
                <h3>Rising Lake Waters & Coastal Threats</h3>
                <p>Several Rift Valley lakes like lake Baringo and Turkana have swelled dramatically,
                     submerging homes, schools, and health facilities. On the coast, sea-level rise
                      threatens infrastructure and freshwater aquifers in low-lying areas of Mombasa and Lamu.</p>

        <h2> Locally-Led Technology & Adaptation Solutions</h2>
        <p>Kenyan innovators are leveraging digital tools and local knowledge to build resilience,
             especially in food security and disaster preparedness.</p>

        <ul class="card-list">
            <li class="card">
                <h3>Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)</h3>
                <p>Adoption of technologies like solar-powered drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting 
                    systems lined water pans is enabling farmers to transition from unreliable
                     rainfed agriculture to high-value horticulture, even in ASALs.</p>

                <h3>Digital Climate Advisories (SMS/App)</h3>
                <p>Platforms are integrating high-resolution satellite and meteorological data like th
                    e Kenya Agricultural Observatory Platform to deliver tailored SMS advisories to hundreds
                     of thousands of farmers and pastoralists on optimal planting times, pest control,
                      and livestock movement.</p>

            <li class="card">
                <h3>Carbon Markets Framework</h3>
                <p>Kenya's new Climate Change Act of 2023 is establishing robust legal and policy guidelines
                     for participation in voluntary carbon markets. This aims to channel private climate
                      finance into community-based projects like afforestation and clean cookstoves.</p>

        <h2> Policy Milestones & Global Leadership</h2>
        <p>Kenya continues to drive the African climate agenda, hosting major international policy forums and consolidating national commitments.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Second Nationally Determined Contribution Kenya submitted its updated NDC in 2025, committing
                 to a 35% reduction in GHG emissions by 2035 relative to the Business As Usual scenario,
                  requiring significant international investment.</li>
            <li>Africa Climate Summit Following the successful hosting of the inaugural ACS in Nairobi (2023),
                 Kenya is focused on implementing the Nairobi Declaration, pushing for climate finance
                  reform and scaling up clean energy investment across the continent.</li>
            <li>UNEP Headquarters: As the host of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya remains a critical diplomatic center for global environmental policy, as seen during events like the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-7).</li>
